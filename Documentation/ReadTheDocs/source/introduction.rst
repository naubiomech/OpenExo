Introduction
============

Welcome to the OpenExo Documentation! This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to our open-source platform, designed to facilitate numerical computation, data acquisition, and control for lower-limb robotic prostheses.

Our project focuses on enhancing mobility and function for individuals with neuromuscular and musculoskeletal disabilities. Through a combination of laboratory experiments, musculoskeletal modeling, and simulation, we strive to understand the underlying mechanisms of movement disorders. The insights gained from these studies directly inform the design and refinement of our innovative wearable robotic devices.

Key topics covered in this documentation include:

- **User Guide:** A concise overview of the coding standards and engineering principles our lab follows.
- **Installation:** Step-by-step guidance to set up the software and hardware components.
- **Adding Elements:** Practical examples that show how to extend the platform with new sensors, actuators, and algorithms.
- **Controllers:** Reference material and tutorials for implementing ankle and elbow controllers.
- **OpenExo GUI:**  A walkthrough of our Python-based graphical application for configuring and controlling the exoskeleton.
- **Documentation:** Instructions for adding pages, diagrams, and API references to the Read the Docs site
- **VS Code + GitHub Quick-Start:** A fast-track guide to creating a fully featured development environment connected to GitHub.
- **Gamification Template** Guidelines and assets for the capstone team’s biofeedback gamification layer.


Whether you're a researcher, engineer, or practitioner, we hope this resource helps you explore and contribute to advancing wearable robotics and rehabilitation technologies.

Happy exploring!
